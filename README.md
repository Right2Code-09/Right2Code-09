# Harshit here! 👋
 My experience as a Web Developer and content creator is approximately 2 years.
Currently, I'm a Front-End Developer, but I'm aspiring to become a Full-Stack Developer. 💻

Teaching others online for free is something I ❤️ to do. An example is YouTube.
I have made 50+ projects to improve my skills and learn about new errors!!
Stackoverflow, LinkedIn, Medium, YouTube and Instagram are just a few online platforms where I am found.

To further gain knowledge and experience, I seek out new opportunities and challenges.
As a result of solving other people's problems, I gain more experience and learn more. 🕵️‍♂️

Join me and ask me your questions. 🙋
